# PayBack

## Abstract

In today's interconnected world, managing shared expenses among friends, family, or roommates can often become a hassle. To address this challenge, we introduce a mobile application designed to streamline the process of splitting bills and facilitating reimbursements. Our app provides users with a user-friendly platform to input shared expenses, accurately divide costs, and efficiently settle debts. With intuitive features and seamless functionality, users can easily track and manage their financial interactions, ensuring transparency and fairness in their monetary transactions. Through automated reminders and real-time updates, our app aims to simplify the complexities of sharing expenses, fostering harmonious financial relationships among its users.
