# PayBack

## Abstract

In today's interconnected world, managing shared expenses among friends, family, or roommates can often become a hassle. To address this challenge, we introduce a mobile application designed to streamline the process of splitting bills and facilitating reimbursements. Our app provides users with a user-friendly platform to input shared expenses, accurately divide costs, and efficiently settle debts. With intuitive features and seamless functionality, users can easily track and manage their financial interactions, ensuring transparency and fairness in their monetary transactions. Through automated reminders and real-time updates, our app aims to simplify the complexities of sharing expenses, fostering harmonious financial relationships among its users.

## Usage

### Backend 
In order to start a backend server, you need to activate a python environment in folder where you have a folder with backend. Use
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
command to create python virtual environment and then use 
```
source venv/bin/activate

After that you need to install Django and Django REST framework with the following commands in command line: 
```
 pip install django

 pip isntall djangorestframework

Then go to the folder with manage.py by typing "cd backend" to get into **backend** directory and then type "cd hci" to get into **hci** and then in command line and start server by typing
